# parser_FIX
This python script downloads the zipped secdef.dat file from CME public FTP site, parses it and extracts specific data from that file.
The secdef.dat contains rows/columns of data from the FIX (Financial Exchange Information) protocol.

The goal is to write a parser without using libraries from Python such as:  pandas module or similar data-processing modules.
