The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) [1] publishes a file from its public FTP site [2] that can be used to
determine information for receiving market data for futures [3] contracts. The file is a FIX protocol [4]
file [5] that contains security definitions [6] for future, spread, and option contracts.

With the version of the secdef.dat file provided, please answer the following questions using python:

1. How many instruments of each security type (tag 167) exist?
2. How many futures (tag 167) instruments exist in each product complex (tag 462)?  
3. What are the names (tag 55) of the earliest four expirations (tag 200) for the futures (tag 167) instruments
   with asset (tag 6937) 'GE' and have zero legs (tag 555)?
